        <h2>Polish Crepes (Nalesniki)</h2>
        <p1>Polish crepes are very popular in Poland for their fruity lightness served with a side of whipped up cottage cheese. I know, it sounds weird. However; once you try these, you will realize how addicting they are.</p1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk or non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2T unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2tsp fine salt</li>
            <li>1T unsalted butter, for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine flour, milk, water, eggs, butter and salt. Mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a crepe pan over medium heat and lightly coat with butter.</li>
            <li>Scoop 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan. Immediately rotate the pan to swirl the batter around until it covers the whole pan. Flip when crepe is lightly brown on one side.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remainder of batter. Serve with some jam and cottage cheese on the side!</li>
        </ol>
        </ul>
